# Chat Application

(Real Time Application With NodeJS)

We are going to build a Chat application. With Chat application we require real time data transfer. As soon as User1 sends a message, User2 should be able to see it. We want as little delay as possible between the User1 sending the message and User2 seeing it.


To get that done we are going to create a realtime node.js app and along the way we will be exploring websocket and the very popular Socket.io library. Socket.io is going to give us every thing we need to setup real time app with node.js.
